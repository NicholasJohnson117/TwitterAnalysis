# TwitterAnalysis
Using Python I excute scripts to pull tweets for a topic, 
build a database to store said project, 
then use Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Cognitive services to 
build a report to be shown what the data says about a certain topic on twitter..

I would like assistance to build up my Python code to be more effecient in gathering data and pushing it into a database
that can be used for data analysis.
